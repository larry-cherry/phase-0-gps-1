#Release 7: Wilson Reflects

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - Prior to the GPS, I was struggling with when to use git fetch and git merge instead of git pull. 
    
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - Our guide Nick helped us work through the git fetch and merge commands and explained why its helpful to understand those commands along with git pull. In terms of git merge, I was thinking about merging a remote feature branch, but the remote master was already updated so I merged that. The work flow makes sense now that I actually completed the exercise.
    
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - I asked a lot of questions about git merge, git fetch, and git diff. When to use them and how to think about the work flow associated with each.

* What still confuses you about Git?
    - I have a basic understanding of the main Git commands, but there is still so much to know. We are working with basic files at this point and these are still new concepts, so its still difficult to wrap my head around the whole process. Working with 100's of files with thousands of lines of code should get really interesting. 
    
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - I really enjoyed it. I was a little concerned going in because I normally like to work alone but this was actually fun. I liked that we could bounce questions off each other, collaborate, and get immediate feedback on questions as well.
